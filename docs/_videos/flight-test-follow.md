## Recorded test flight
This video tests the follow control solution. The companion computer
is running the follow program, and validates whether it can
keep track of and follow a moving target during a non-simulated flight. The setup will be
identical to the third test in section 4.4.2, without needing a wireless telemetry connection.
The telemetry radio is, therefore, free to be used, for example, to track the vehicleâ€™s path
through the QGroundControl application on a secondary, offboard computer. The control
application will be started with the following command:

<p style="text-align: center;">dronecontrol follow -s /dev/serial0:921600</p>

This video shows the process of getting the vehicle to takeoff (T key), activating offboard
flight mode (O key), and starting movement tracking of the detected figure.
