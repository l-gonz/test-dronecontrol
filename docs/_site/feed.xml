This thesis aims to demonstrate how this platform can be used to develop solutions that integrate computer vision techniques and use their input to control the movement of an aerial vehicle, while employing easily-available and affordable hardware with basic specifications. For this purpose, a viable solution is presented that allows a drone to use an onboard camera to identify and keep track of a person in its field of view to follow their movement.</subtitle></feed>
